1-Unistall iBoss (check the guide in the GitHu)
2-Go to Safari or Chrome, and look up for the most nish and unknown browser
(popular ones are blocked) (Chromium based browsers are better)
3-Go to the extensions store from that browser 
(if chromium based, the google chrome extension store shohld work)
4- Look up for "UltraSurf VPN" 
(Best 100% free VPN)
5- Install it and activate it, while activated , you can browser in any web, without censorship 

NOTES:
By the day I am creating this guide, there js a browser that is very useful, it's called "Iron browser"
If you want to download that one take in consideration that you gotta change the browser name before opening it
Just right click the icon and click rename, rename it to whatever , like "Metal" or "Steel"
Then you cab use it
